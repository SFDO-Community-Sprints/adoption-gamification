### Project Team Accomplishments
What did the Project Team accomplished during the Sprint?
-- base schema created
-- two simple triggers
-- two sample procsess builder processes
-- one sample flow

### Contributing
If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?
-- consider using a trigger for the reward assignment piece (tallying points etc) as dealing with flows in automated deployments can be a very tricky thing to manage.
-- investigate the usage of a rules engine
-- create settings for things like default status for certain types of rewards
   -- create a UI for managing these settings
   -- have the triggers/flows/etc leverage these settings rather than hard-coding
-- support nuermous types of rewards
   -- badges
   -- physical rewards (need fullfillment)
   -- point threshold rewards (rolling totals)
-- Reward groups
